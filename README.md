# paseto.zig

A Zig implementation of Paseto token encode / decode as an alternative to JWT

Implemented as local only at this stage

# Install

For Zig 0.15-dev-855 only at this stage.  Till 0.15 lands, stdlib is changing by the day, and too hard to keep up with.

Will do a total refactor of this after 0.15 becomes stable

# Encode - Create a local token with encrypted payload

# Decode - Validate a token and extract its payload
